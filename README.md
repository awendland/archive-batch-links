## Archive.org Batch Links

Improved version of something I quickly through together at [Archive.org Bulk URL Operations | Codepen](https://codepen.io/awendland/pen/LYYwLPB).

### Dev

* Use _yarn start_ to start the dev server (both client and FaaS)
* Use _yarn test_ to run unit tests
* Use _yarn build_ to build for production

This is an application built with [AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun) and using [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/).

### Quick Thoughts

This was shockingly easy to build. AppRun has a great approach that makes it super quick to hit the ground running. I'll probably using it for quickshot projects in the future :)
